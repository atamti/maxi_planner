- [x] Add portfolio insights and risk analysis
- [x] Create loan calculation utilities

## ‚úÖ Phase 3: State Management Consolidation

- [x] Consolidate state management patterns
- [x] Create unified portfolio context
- [x] Implement backward compatibility layers
- [x] Optimize state update patterns

## ‚úÖ Phase 4: Hook Organization & Standardization

- [x] **Allocation Hooks**: `useAllocation` + `useAllocationAdjustment` ‚Üí `useAllocationEnhanced`
- [x] **Portfolio Analysis**: `usePortfolioAnalysis` + `usePortfolioInsights` ‚Üí `usePortfolioAnalysisEnhanced`
- [x] **Calculation Engine**: `useCalculations` + `useLoanCalculations` ‚Üí `useCalculationsEnhanced`
- [ ] **Rate Generation**: Consolidate overlapping rate generation hooks
- [ ] **Chart Data**: Consolidate chart-related calculation utilities
- [ ] **Form State**: Examine form validation and state management overlaps

### Consolidation Pattern

Each consolidation follows this proven pattern:

1. **Identify Overlap**: Find hooks with duplicate functionality
2. **Create Enhanced Hook**: Consolidate features into single enhanced hook
3. **Maintain Compatibility**: Provide compatibility wrappers for existing APIs
4. **Comprehensive Testing**: Create test suites covering all functionality
5. **Verify Integration**: Ensure no regressions in existing code

### Completed Consolidations

#### üéØ Allocation Hooks (5/5 tests passing)

- **Combined**: Portfolio allocation logic and adjustment utilities
- **Enhanced Features**: Validation, error handling, comprehensive calculations
- **Backward Compatibility**: `useAllocationCompat()` for existing usage

#### üéØ Portfolio Analysis (16/16 tests passing)

- **Combined**: Core analysis methods + enhanced insights with loan integration
- **Enhanced Features**: Cashflow analysis, portfolio growth tracking, mix evolution
- **Backward Compatibility**: Original hooks maintain API compatibility

#### üéØ Calculation Engine (24/24 tests passing)

- **Combined**: Main calculation engine + loan-specific utilities
- **Enhanced Features**: BTC growth, loan calculations, utility methods
- **Backward Compatibility**: `useCalculationsCompat()` and `useLoanCalculationsCompat()`

## üöÄ Phase 5: Test Coverage Analysis & Enhancement

- [ ] Analyze current test coverage gaps
- [ ] Implement missing test scenarios
- [ ] Create integration test suites
- [ ] Performance testing for calculation-heavy operations
- [ ] Error boundary testing

## üîç Phase 6: Proper Logging Infrastructure

- [x] **Logging System**: Created structured logging utility (`src/utils/logger.ts`)
- [x] **Debug Cleanup**: Removed all console.log/console.debug from source files
- [ ] **Strategic Logging**: Add proper logging to key application flows
- [ ] **Performance Monitoring**: Add performance logging for calculations
- [ ] **Error Tracking**: Implement error logging and reporting
- [ ] **User Action Tracking**: Log user interactions for analytics

### Logging Features

#### üõ† Logger Infrastructure

- **Log Levels**: DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR with environment-based filtering
- **Structured Data**: JSON-formatted log entries with timestamps and context
- **Console Output**: Collapsible grouped console output in development
- **Log Storage**: In-memory log storage with configurable retention
- **Export Capability**: JSON export for debugging and analysis

#### üéØ Convenience Functions

- `logCalculation()` - For mathematical operations and results
- `logFormUpdate()` - For form field changes and validation
- `logChartRender()` - For chart rendering and data visualization
- `logUserAction()` - For user interactions and UI events
- `logError()` - For error conditions with full context
- `logPerformance()` - For performance monitoring and optimization

## üìã Phase 7: Component Architecture Enhancement

- [ ] Implement advanced component patterns
- [ ] Create reusable component library
- [ ] Optimize rendering performance
- [ ] Implement lazy loading strategies

## üé® Phase 8: UI/UX Polish & Accessibility

- [ ] Deployment pipeline
- [ ] Documentation completion

## Current Status

**Active Phase**: 4 (Hook Organization & Standardization)  
**Overall Progress**: 40% complete
**Test Coverage**: 438/438 tests passing
**Recent Achievement**: Successfully consolidated calculation engine hooks with full backward compatibility

## Next Steps

1. **Continue Phase 4**: Identify and consolidate remaining hook duplications
2. **Strategic Logging**: Implement proper logging in key application flows
3. **Rate Generation**: Consolidate rate generation hook overlaps
4. **Chart Data**: Examine chart calculation utilities for consolidation opportunities
